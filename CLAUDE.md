# PinPOINT IMS — read this first

Investment micro-system for a long/short book. Built from scratch starting
2026-08-15 for the PM (Rajvaibhav Yadav, PinPOINT Fund). Localhost only, no
hosting cost, no cloud.

```bash
cd C:\Users\rajvaibhav.yadav\pinpoint-ims
python packages/api/serve.py          # -> http://127.0.0.1:8770
python packages/daily.py              # dry run; --run to execute
python packages/score/bridge.py --peer-group aluminium_primary --from-store 30
```

## THE OLD VAULT SYSTEM IS NOT THIS PROJECT

`OneDrive - PinPOINT\Obsidian Vault` contains a previous system — `/daily`,
knowledge cards, `Scoring/`, event-pipeline workflows. **The PM explicitly
called it trash and asked for a completely new system. Do not read it for
methodology, do not copy its scoring, do not run it.**

`Desktop\CLAUDE.md` documents that old system in detail and will auto-load if a
session starts from Desktop. **It is not relevant here.** Same for the two
memory entries about `/pm` and `Portfolio Management/`.

Three things from the vault ARE used, because they are *data*, not methodology:

| Path | Used for |
|---|---|
| `Broker Mails/*.md` | 44 dated digests — the extraction corpus |
| `Coverage/*/*/OI History.md` | futures OI, already computed daily |
| — | nothing else |

---

## The one inversion everything rests on

**The model extracts cited facts. Deterministic code scores them.**

The previous attempt had an LLM read broker prose and emit a score directly.
That produces numbers that are not reproducible, not decomposable and not
testable — which is why its output read as jargon rather than direction.

## Four pillars, deliberately not more

A ten-factor model overfits and goes rigid. The PM was explicit about this.

| | Question | Determines | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** ASP | What do they realise? | direction + size | scoring |
| **P2** Costs | What do they consume? | direction + size | scoring |
| **P3** Valuation | Is it already priced? | conviction | **scorer NOT built** |
| **P4** Guidance | Will they hit the quarter? | forward view | scoring |
| Gate | Tezi/mandi — can it express? | permission | schema only |

P1+P2 is the margin bridge. `market_pct` is the field that does the work: a
captive input contributes ZERO to cost however far its market price moves.
That, not a coefficient, is why one alumina print moves NALCO up, VAML down and
Hindalco barely.

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **No number without a citation.** `observations.quote` and
   `guidance.quote` are NOT NULL with non-empty CHECKs.
2. **No intensity without provenance.** `economics.source_note` likewise.
3. **Silence changes nothing.** There is no decay anywhere. A quiet name shows
   rising `stale_days` and an unchanged score. Never add decay.
4. **Score the spread, do not spread the scores.** The curve is flat in the
   tails, so subtracting two scores understated a real 1.75pp gap as 0.09
   points. Pair score is `score(pct_long - pct_short)`.
5. **`base_ebitda` IS the beta.** If a modelled beta disagrees with the
   observed one, fix `base_ebitda` or accept the gap as a P3 effect. NEVER
   insert a fudge factor to make them agree.
6. **A proxy is never aliased to the thing it proxies.** SHFE zinc is
   `zinc_shfe`, never `lme_zinc`. Seaborne coal is `thermal_coal_seaborne`,
   never `thermal_coal_eauction`.
7. **Withhold rather than guess.** No score when `coverage_ok` is false; no
   broker action without a named broker; no row for a name not in F&O.

## Scoring

`score = 3.0 + 2.0 * sgn(x) * |x/k|^p / (1 + |x/k|^p)`, hill form, `p = 1.5`,
anchored so 5% of EBITDA reads 4.0 (hence `k = 0.05`). Config in
`specs/scoring.yaml`. Calibrate by moving the ANCHOR, not `k`.

P4 scores **linearly** (`1 + 4*confidence`) because a confidence is already a
bounded probability — squashing it again would distort it.

## Gotchas that already cost time

- **Port 8765 is the vault's node dashboard** (running since 13 Aug). We use
  **8770**. A bind clash does not error visibly — the other server answers and
  every request 404s as if routing were broken.
- **FRED rejects a browser User-Agent** (`ECONNRESET`); use `curl/8.0`. Yahoo
  requires the opposite. Do not unify them.
- **SQLite GLOB: `_` is a LITERAL underscore**, not a wildcard (that is LIKE).
  `GLOB '____-__-__'` rejected every valid date and passed every test, because
  the tests only checked that bad rows are REJECTED. Every guard needs an
  ACCEPTANCE test too.
- **Digest filenames are `DD-MM-YYYY.md`** — plain `sorted()` orders by day of
  month. Always sort on the parsed ISO date.
- **Verify a Yahoo symbol by NAME, not instrumentType.** `ZN=F` is the 10-Year
  T-Note. `ZNC=F` is a dead 2019 contract returning a frozen price. `ALA=F`
  reports `ALTSYMBOL` and is perfectly live. Resolve tickers with
  `packages/adapters/yahoo_search.py` — do not guess (VAML.NS cost three wrong
  guesses).
- **VEDL's price history has an unadjusted demerger**: 773.60 → 271.55 on
  2026-04-30, −64.9%. Anything crossing that date compares two different
  companies. `check_corporate_actions.py` scans for this.
- **Windows are CALENDAR DAYS, not row counts.** The store mixes daily equities
  with monthly IMF series; N rows back is N *months* on a monthly series.
- **`.gitignore` needs `data/*` not `data/`** — git will not descend into an
  excluded directory, so a negation can never re-include the staging file.
- **Write commit messages with the Write tool to a file, then `git commit -F`.**
  PowerShell here-strings mangle quotes and `-Encoding utf8` adds a BOM.

## Wind MCP

The Wind MCP is callable by the **agent**, not by a Python process. So fetch
and load are separate by necessity: the agent calls
`get_wind_historical_data(ZN.SHF, ...)`, writes the result to
`data/staging/`, and an adapter converts and loads it. Staging files are
version-controlled — they are the dated record of what Wind returned.

---

## Where the reasoning lives

**`git log` is the real record.** Every commit message states what was found,
what was fixed, what was deliberately NOT fixed, and why. Read it before
changing anything — many decisions look arbitrary until you see what they
prevent.

```bash
git log --format='%h %s' | head -30
git log -1 --format=%B <sha>       # full reasoning for one change
```

## Current state (as of 2026-08-16, 17 commits)

Built and running: schema + guards, Yahoo/FRED/Wind/vault-OI adapters, P1+P2
bridge, scoring curve, P4 guidance, local API + 4-tab front-end with an
editable override path.

**Not built:** P3 scorer, regime gate, signal emission with falsifiers, the
review/outcome loop (L5), OI as a conviction modifier, book ingestion.

**Two spec/implementation gaps:** `scoring.yaml` specifies EWMA accumulation
(half-life 10d) but the bridge uses a plain window delta; and the bridge does
NOT persist — `economics`, `bridge_runs`, `signals` are all empty, so there is
no score history and nothing can be backtested yet. That backtest is the gate
standing before any second sector.

**Numbers still provisional** (`verify: pending` in the specs): all
intensities, NALCO's alumina surplus tonnage, VAML's alumina `market_pct`,
the coal `basis_pass_through` of 0.35, and Hindalco's `base_ebitda` — the only
denominator not sourced from a cited print.
